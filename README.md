# PHP-simple-file-sharer
A custom file upload system based on PHP, with login and a downloads page.

The index.php is where the system login is located. A JSON file is used to store the username and password in 'modules/logins.json'. After logging in, it redirects to 'pages/home.php' where you can upload, delete, and obtain the link to the saved files.

With this link, you go to a download page that has an ad above the download button and a text area below.
